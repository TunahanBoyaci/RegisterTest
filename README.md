## Overview
One essential aspect of any web application is user registration, which demands rigorous testing to ensure a smooth user experience. 
To achieve this, we have implemented a Java-based automation script using Selenium WebDriver, a popular tool for automating browser interactions. Our script simulates the user registration process on a sample website (https://www.lidl.com/register) and tests its key functionalities.
